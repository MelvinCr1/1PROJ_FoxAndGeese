# FOX AND GEESE - Readme

## 1. Context of the project

The company "Puzzle Games" wants to adapt the game "Fox And Geese" in a digital version. It is looking for a subcontractor to develop a desktop version of this game on the three main current operating systems: Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The contract concerns the design and development of an abstract combinatorial strategy game, including a new graphic theme, full mouse game management and several features.


## 2. Project description

### 2.1 - The game

"Fox And Geese" is an abstract combinatorial strategy game for two players, where each player must reach the opposite side of the board before their opponent by using pawns and barriers to block the other player's advance.

Complete resources on the game and its rules are available on GitHub.


### 2.2 - General features to implement
